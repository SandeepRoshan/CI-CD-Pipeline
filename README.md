**GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline Explanation**
*What Does the Pipeline Do?*
The pipeline automates the process of build, test, and validation of code every time you push changes to the main branch or create a pull request. Specifically, it:

Checks Out the Code:

actions/checkout@v3 pulls the latest version of your code from GitHub into the runner (virtual machine). This is the first step so that subsequent steps work with the correct code.
Sets Up Node.js:

actions/setup-node@v3 configures Node.js (version 16 in this case) on the runner so that it can execute JavaScript-based tasks, such as installing dependencies and running tests.
Installs Dependencies:

The npm install command installs the project’s dependencies (e.g., Express, Jest). This is necessary because the dependencies are required to run the application and tests.
Runs Tests:

**npm test executes the Jest testing framework, which runs the test cases defined in your test/app.test.js file. It checks if the application’s behavior (e.g., sending the correct response on the / endpoint) is working as expected.
Why Is Each Step Automated?**
**1. Code Checkout (actions/checkout)**

Automation Reason: This step ensures that every time you run the pipeline, you're working with the latest version of the code. Without this, the pipeline would not have access to the most up-to-date version of your repository, which could lead to incorrect or outdated builds.
**2. Node.js Setup (actions/setup-node)**

Automation Reason: This automates the setup of the Node.js runtime and ensures consistency across all environments (e.g., your local machine and GitHub's CI environment). By specifying a Node.js version (16), it guarantees that the right version is used for building and testing your application.
**3. Dependency Installation (npm install)**

Automation Reason: This ensures that the latest dependencies defined in the package.json file are installed automatically. Without automation, developers would need to manually install dependencies every time they run the tests, which is error-prone and inefficient. Automation ensures consistency, as all dependencies are installed the same way every time.
**4. Running Tests (npm test)**

**Automation Reason: Automating tests ensures that every time new code is added, it’s verified automatically. Running tests ensures that the code behaves as expected and prevents bugs from being introduced. It also allows for quick feedback after each code change, which improves the overall development speed and ensures the integrity of your codebase.
Why Use CI/CD (Automation) in the First Place?**
Continuous Integration (CI):

Definition: CI is the practice of automatically integrating code changes into a shared repository multiple times a day, running tests, and ensuring that the changes don’t break the existing codebase.
Why It's Automated: Developers don’t need to manually test or check the code after every change. By automating this, it’s easier to spot issues early, leading to fewer bugs and more stable code.
Continuous Delivery (CD):

Definition: CD automates the process of pushing code changes to production after they’ve passed tests. In this case, it could be extended to deploy your app to a staging or production environment.
Why It's Automated: Automating deployment ensures consistent and reliable releases. Without automation, the deployment process could be error-prone and inconsistent.
